# CoS Platform Setup

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (includes Docker Compose)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cos
```

## First-time Configuration

Before starting the platform, create your local config file:

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

Then open `config.yaml` and fill in the required values — at minimum:
- `llm.api_key` — your Anthropic API key
- `database.password` — must match the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` value in `docker-compose.yml` (default: `postgres`)

`config.yaml` is git-ignored and never committed. `config.yaml.example` is the safe template that stays in the repo.

## Start the Platform

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

All three services (postgres, tika, cos) will start and reach a healthy state within 60 seconds.

## Check Platform Status

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Shows all three services and their health state. All should show `healthy` or `running`.

## Configure the MCP Server

Connect Claude to the CoS MCP server so it can call the platform's tools.

### Claude Code (CLI)

Run from the `cos/` directory:

```bash
claude mcp add cos -- docker compose exec -i cos uv run cos-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add the following to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cos": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["compose", "exec", "-i", "cos", "uv", "run", "cos-mcp"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/cos"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/cos` with the full path to your `cos/` directory.

The `cos` container runs `cos-mcp` as its persistent process. The MCP client starts a second `cos-mcp` instance inside the same container via `docker compose exec -i` (stdio transport). Both instances share Postgres and config — this is safe and expected.

## Restart the Platform

Three-step restart procedure:

```bash
# Step 1 — stop all services
docker compose down

# Step 2 — start again
docker compose up -d

# Step 3 — verify all services are healthy
docker compose ps
```

No manual intervention is needed between steps.

## View Logs

```bash
docker compose logs cos
```

Streams structured JSON logs from the cos service. To follow logs in real time:

```bash
docker compose logs -f cos
```
